            <p>Waterbending, one of the four elemental bending arts, is the hydrokinetic ability to control water in all
                of its various forms. This type of bending is used by the people of the Water Tribe, who are divided
                into the Southern, Northern, and lesser-known Foggy Swamp tribes, as well as those of the United
                Republic, each with their own unique bending style.</p>
            <p>Water is the element of change.[1] The moon is the source of power in waterbending, and the original
                waterbenders learned to bend by observing how the moon pushed and pulled the tides.[2] The Water Tribes
                are the only people who did not learn to bend from an animal, though the Moon and Ocean Spirits took the
                form of koi fish in the mortal world near the beginning of the Avatar world.</p>
            <p>The fighting style of waterbending is mostly fluid and graceful, acting in concert with the environment.
                Waterbenders deal with the flow of energy; they let their defense become their offense, turning their
                opponents' own forces against them. Even when waterbenders do take an attack stance, their moves always
                appear to flow from one to the other, mimicking the flow of the water they bend. Foggy Swamp style
                waterbending, however, is more rigid and straight, allowing for more direct bursts instead of long
                flowing streams of water.

            <p>Earthbending, one of the four elemental bending arts, is the geokinetic ability to manipulate earth and
                rock in all their various forms, prevalent in the Earth Kingdom and the United Republic.</p>
            <p>Earth is the element of substance, while the people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse, strong, and
                enduring.[1] Following the lion turtles' decision to relinquish their role as protectors of mankind, Oma
                and Shu were the first earthbenders to learn this art from the badgermoles. </p>
            <p>The key to earthbending is utilizing neutral jing, which involves waiting and listening for the right
                moment to strike and, when that moment comes, acting decisively. In other words, earthbenders generally
                endure their enemies' attacks until the right opportunity to counterattack reveals itself.</p>

            <header id="header-fire">Fire</header>
            <p>Firebending, one of the four elemental bending arts, is the pyrokinetic ability to control fire. It is
                unique among the bending arts, as it is the only one in which the performer can generate the element.
                The first human firebenders lived in a city atop a lion turtle during the era of Raava and the art later
                spread to the Sun Warriors,[3] the Fire Nation, and the United Republic of Nations.[5][6] The Earth
                Kingdom also has a small firebending minority. </p>
            <p>As described by Iroh,[1] fire is the element of power, consisting of overpowering force tempered by the
                unflinching will to accomplish tasks and desires. However, during the Hundred Year War, a militaristic
                Fire Nation twisted this into firebending being fueled by rage, hatred, and anger. Firebending draws its
                power from the sun, and the first human firebenders derived their firebending techniques from the
                dragons.</p>
            <p>Firebending is known for its intense and aggressive attacking style and general lack of adequate
                defensive moves, although firebenders can modify offensive maneuvers to function as a defense, such as
                creating large walls of fire[2] or shooting down incoming attacks with fire jabs.</p>

            <header id="header-air">Air</header>
            <p>Airbending, one of the four elemental bending arts, is the aerokinetic ability to control and manipulate
                air. The peaceful Air Nomads utilized this type of bending in their everyday lives. </p>
            <p>Air is the element of freedom.[1] The Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly problems and concerns;
                finding peace and freedom was the key to solving their difficulties in life. Airbenders continually
                sought spiritual enlightenment, and, as a result, all children born into the Air Nomads were benders.
                The first airbenders learned their art from the flying bison. </p>
            <p>The key to airbending is flexibility and finding and following the path of least resistance. Airbending
                is notable for being almost purely defensive, as well as the most dynamic of the four bending arts.
                Airbenders can overwhelm many opponents at once with large and powerful attacks that could prove fatal;
                however, due to the pacifist nature of the Air Nomads, such attacks are rarely used. Instead, an
                airbender strives to use the opponents' energy against them.[3] Due to their aforementioned
                spirituality, they often adapt to the situation surrounding them and employ negative jing, preferring
                evasive maneuvers as opposed to direct confrontation. </p>

            <p>Energybending[4] is the ability to bend another person's life energy. It predates the four main bending
                arts, the formation of the four nations, as well as the creation of the Avatar.</p>
            <p>Before the Avatar came into existence and the separation of the four nations, the lion turtles bent the
                energy within humans and themselves in order to grant them the ability to bend one of the four elements.
                However, after the lion turtles renounced their roles as protectors of mankind, energybending was no
                longer used to grant people bending, and the knowledge of energybending was almost completely lost.[5]
                By 100 AG, there was only one lion turtle left with the ability to energybend who later passed down the
                ability to Avatar Aang,[2] who used it to remove Phoenix King Ozai's firebending[1] and, twenty-eight
                years later, Yakone's ability to waterbend.[6] After the Equalists' leader, Amon, severed Korra's
                bending, save for her airbending, Aang's spirit used energybending to restore her ability to bend all
                elements and passed the knowledge of energybending onto her. Later, Korra used it to return Lin
                Beifong's ability to earthbend[3] and stop Kuvira's spirit energy cannon. </p>
            <p>The capabilities of energybending are not well understood; what is known is that bending a person's life
                energy can impart them with knowledge instantly, remove their bending completely, or restore it. This
                bending art can be perilous to the user,[1] which is why so few have ever used it. In addition, even
                though mastering the four elements is a necessity for the Avatar, learning energybending is optional.
